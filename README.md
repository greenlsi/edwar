#### signal Error Detection for WBSN And data Recovery.
Edwar is a system based on several
modules that allows processing of data collected by different 
devices such as [E4](https://www.empatica.com/en-eu/research/e4/) or 
[Everion](https://www.biovotion.com/everion/).

The processing focuses on features extraction, but it can include signal error
detection, and signal correction or reconstruction. This core version allows working with
electrodermal activity (EDA), interbeat intervals (IBI), accelerometry (ACC) and temperature (TEMP).

The results can be saved as an output variable, CSV files or in a data base.
