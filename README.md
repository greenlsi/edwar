#### signal Error Detection for WBSN And data Recovery.
Edwar is a system based on several
modules that allows processing of data collected by different 
devices such as [E4](https://www.empatica.com/en-eu/research/e4/) or 
[Everion](https://www.biovotion.com/everion/).

The processing focuses on features extraction, but it can include signal error
detection, and signal correction or reconstruction.
